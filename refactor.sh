# This will be a script to completely reorganize the directories and repositories on my local machine.

# Needs
# Phase 1: (Manual)
#   - Ensure no files or directories need to be removed or deleted.
#   - Ensure all of the files and directories have the proper names/titles
#
# Phase 2: (Script)
#   - Ensure all the proper directories and sub-directories are made.
#  - Write script to create the tree structure desired
#  - Use the second half of the script to move everything into the appropriate places



# IMPORTANT:
# Ensure that no .git files are present and git is not initalized in the local parent directories because it will mess uo the path in GH.
# If you are going to move/rename folders or files you must do it locally and ensure no major chains were broken prior to pushing up to github
